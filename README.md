## Key Business Questions
- What is the total revenue and total number of orders?
- Which pizza categories and sizes generate the most revenue?
- What are the best selling pizzas?

- Peak Hour period occur at mid-day, indicating lunchtime as the top demand window.

## Recommendations
- Business should plan inventory for high demand month to avoid stock-out
- Business should increase staffing in both kitchen and delivery during mid-days(11pm-1pm) and also on weekends to ensure smooth customer experience
- Business should halt production of extra large pizzas and focus more on large, medium and small pizza. Combo deals should be introduced for customers seeking more than one large pizza, filling the gap left by low-demand XL/XXL size
- Business should introduce marketing campaign for underperforming business category like Veggie pizzas. This could include promotional bundles or discounts to increase visibility in this category.
